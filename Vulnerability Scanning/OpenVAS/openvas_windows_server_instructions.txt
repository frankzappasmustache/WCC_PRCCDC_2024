Enable Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL): Follow the official Microsoft documentation to enable WSL on your Windows Server machine.

Install a Linux Distribution: Install a Linux distribution from the Microsoft Store, such as Ubuntu or Debian.

Install OpenVAS on Linux: Use the Linux distribution installed in WSL to install and configure OpenVAS. You can use the script provided earlier for Ubuntu 20.04 with minor adjustments, as WSL provides a Linux-like environment.

Access OpenVAS Web Interface: Once OpenVAS is installed and configured, you can access the web interface by opening a web browser on your Windows Server machine and navigating to https://localhost:443.
